# DataDrivenWeight
An Android/iOS app that will help make documenting daily weight as easy as taking a picture

Idea: instead of having to physically type in his weight every day on a spreadsheet (which he will definitely forget to do), Appa (or me or anyone else) can take a picture of the scale every morning. The app and backend will handle the rest.
